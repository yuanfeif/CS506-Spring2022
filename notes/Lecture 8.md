# Leture 8: 
##Soft Clustering
$P(X=x) = P(C_1)P(X=x|C_1) + P(C_2)P(X=x|C_1)$

**A Gaussion Mixture Model (GMM)** is a mixture model where $P(X =x|C_i) \sim N(σ,μ) $

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**  this is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function. 


##GMM Clustering
Goal: MLE the distribution lilelihood function
hint: $k \neq n$ 

##Clusrering Aggregation
**Goals**:
1. Compare clusterings: 
how to compare? pick two points to check whether they are clustered into the same cluster
...
**Disagreement Distance**
Is $D(P,C)$ a distance function? yes
